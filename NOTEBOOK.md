# Notebook of Ideas, Thoughts, and Mental Ramblings...

If inspiration were an animal, it would be a cat!  Finicky, feisty when cornered, and always giving you "that look" when you try to
call it to you like a dog. Finding good ideas for anything can be a challenge. Finding compelling ideas for text-based games can be 
especially difficult.  _Unless, of course, you know where—and how—to look_.

### Finding Inspiration for Your Interactive Fiction

In many ways, looking for text-based game ideas is a lot like seeking out inspiration for any other fiction project. 
You’ll want to start by reading what you want to write—in this case, interactive fiction (IF) games. 
The good news is, there are lots of free text-based games out there, many of which can be played directly in your browser or even on your phone.

When playing these games for research (play some just for fun, too!), take note of _anything_ that sparks your creativity along the way, such as:
  * Narrative elements (e.g. characters, plot points, setting, overall story structure)
  * Game mechanics (e.g. stats, puzzles, gameplay goals, multiple endings)
  * Artistic elements (e.g. visual layout, graphics, sound effects, music—not every text-based game is text-only)

A good rule of thumb: if it makes you wonder how the developer did it, or if you feel strongly about it (positively or negatively), 
it’s an element worth looking into. 

### Creative Ways to Devise Text-Based Game Ideas

If you need ideas for the following scenarios or aspects of your game, here are some common ideas worth considering:

**Narrative elements**
  * Playing D&D or other RPGs—anything narrative-forward
  * Playing The Sims or other simulation games—great for character ideas and worldbuilding
  * Listening or watching musicalsReading nonfiction or watching documentaries about odd or niche topics that interest you
  * Keeping a diary (and then mining it for inspirational fodder)

**Game mechanics**
  * Puzzle-solving—jigsaw puzzles, strategy games, crosswords, logic puzzles, etc.
  * Playing around in Twine and other IF builders
  * Looking up how things work (not just video games—anything you’re interested in learning about how it’s made or how it’s done)

**Artistic elements, even if you only describe it through dialogue and description!**
  * Go to art museums or browse online galleries.  Learn about art theory and history!
  * Listen to new music—not just new releases, but artists and genres with which you are unfamiliar
  * Go spend some time in nature or a new environment and pay attention to how everything looks or feels; jot down notes

### A Brief Tour of the Places Where Other's have Found Inspiration for Text Adventure's (Interactive Fiction) 
  * Infocom games often have straightforward writing and descriptions that lead to a dry sense of humor, but also rewarding stories that are full of twists and turns.
  * Inspiration for "The Harbinger’s Head" came from the short story, "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow," but also from Irish mythology and the Japanese anime Durarara
  * The Dragon’s Last Flight was influenced by movies like Dragonheart and "Howl’s Moving Castle," the manga "The Ancient Magus’s Bride."

### Infocom Foundation and Zork

Infocom began as a collaboration between Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) faculty and alumni, some of whom had previously worked 
a text-based adventure game called Zork.  Development of Zork began in 1977 at the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science, 
with an initial team including Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, and Dave Lebling, as well as Bruce Daniels. 
Inspired by the famous "Colossal Cave Adventure," the developers aspired to improve on the formula with a more robust text parser 
and more logical puzzles.

They did not announce their game while it was in development, but a lack of security on the MIT systems 
meant that anyone who could access the PDP-10 computer over the ARPANET could see what programs were being run. 
As a result, a small community of people discovered the new "Zork" adventure game and spread word of it under that name.
This community interacted with the developers as they created the game, playtesting additions and submitting bug reports.

Infocom was officially founded as a software company on June 22, 1979.  By the end of the year, the core Zork game was complete, 
and Berez was elected the company's president. The studio began seeking a professional publisher with store and distributor connections. 
After Microsoft passed on the project due to competition with their own Microsoft Adventure (1979), Infocom negotiated a 
publishing agreement with Personal Software, one of the first professional software publishing companies.

However, Infocom grew wary of the publisher's lack of advertising for Zork I, and lack of enthusiasm for additional episodes and games. 
The developer decided to self-publish their games from that moment forward, buying out Personal Software's remaining inventory of Zork games.

Following its 1980 release, Zork I became a bestseller from 1983 through 1985.  By 1986, the game had sold 380,000 copies, 
with 680,000 sales for the trilogy overall, comprising one-third of Infocom's two million game sales.
Reviewers hailed Zork as the best adventure game to date, with later critics regarding it as one of the greatest games of all time.

Infocom games were popular, InfoWorld said, in part because "in offices all over America (more than anyone realizes) executives and managers
are playing games on their computers". An estimated 25% had a computer game "hidden somewhere in their drawers", Inc. reported, 
and they preferred Infocom adventures to arcade games.  The company stated that year that 75% of players were over 25 years old 
and that 80% were men; more women played its games than other companies', especially the mysteries. 
Most players enjoyed reading books; in 1987 president Joel Berez stated, "[Infocom's] audience tends to be composed of heavy readers. 
We sell to the minority that does read".

Historians noted the game as a foundation for the adventure game genre, as well as influencing the MUD and massively multiplayer 
online role-playing game genres.

### In Conclusion
The main thing you need to do is keep your eyes and your mind open. Inspiration, like cats, has a way of surprising us in unlikely places
when we least expect it. Rather than try to predict or control it, I’ve found it’s best to just be ready to receive it whenever it chooses
to manifest itself—while cultivating the discipline necessary to write without it in the meantime.

When the ideas do come—and they will, if you welcome them—be ready to write them down to save for later. Don’t trust your memory. 
Trust your words; they will last longer.
