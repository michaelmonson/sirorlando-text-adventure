# sirorlando-text-adventure
My first attempt at creating a nostalgic Text Adventure game to hail back to the golden age of Adventure, Colossal Cave, Zork!, and many other Infocom classics.  For those of you who grew up in the modern age of Windows and beyond, you may not have an appreciation for the text-driven adventures of 30 years ago.  The stories were compelling, engaging, and made use of clever language parsor's.  Infocom truly redefined the genre of the early adventure games by creating a language parsor intelligent enough to handle much more than simple noun-verb commands.  It could break apart more complex sentances and understand an impressive number of verbs.  

My goal with this project will be to build an intelligent language parsor and capability reminisicent of the Infocom Text Adventures.

As I work towards Java 1.8 certification, I felt this would be a fun way to practice a variety of Java skills.
